GPL: (GNU General Public License)
- Description: This is a copyleft license that requires works to be open-sourced under the GPL also.
- Pros: Ensures the software is free and open source, this encourages contributions.
- Cons: This is restrictive for commercial use; all derivative works must also be open source under GPL.
- Decision: Not chosen due to the restrictions on commercialization

LGPL: (Lesser General Public License)
- Description: Similar to GPL but it allows linking with closed-source propietary software.
- Pros: Offers greater flexibility than GPL in commerical applications.
- Cons: Restrictions still exist which hinder commercialization
- Decision: This option was considered but ultimately not chosen for its restrictions.

MIT License
- Description: A free software license with little restrictions on how software can be used and distributed.
- Pros: Allows for use in both open-source and propietary software
- Cons: Offers less protections against propietary exploitation
- Decision: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility
